# brick-breaker

A web game, made with HTML,c CSS, and JavaScript, that feels like a standard brick-breaker, but with a twist.
<br>  
You have two pads. One is controlled by your WASD keys, and the other is controlled by your arrow keys.

Okay, onto the real twist.
<br>  
You have to listen to music and every few seconds you will hear some beeps, after that a "swap" noise occurs, and behold! Your controls have swapped!

There are 3 levels. You gain points based on how many bricks you have broken and how quickly you completed them until a certain point. Try and go for a higher score!
